The \u201cPEACE TOURNAMENTS 2025\u201d The Peace Tournament Project will host our 3rd edition of the Peace Tournament in Nakivale Refugee Camp it will begin on 20th May up to 20th June 2025. We strongly believe that our football, art and music tournaments align with our mission of promoting solidarity through volunteerism and promoting peace through fair play. within our community to showcase and support the talents of refugee children. By fostering social cohesion and promoting peace among refugees, we aim to create an environment that allows children to thrive and find solace away from the stress associated with their displacement. The main objective of organizing the Peace Tournament in the Refugee Children Community is to provide a platform for refugees to not only showcase their sporting, musical, and arts prowess, but also to promote unity, understanding, and integration within the international community. By coming together for a common goal, individuals from diverse backgrounds can forge bonds, break down barriers, and create a sense of solidarity. Our tournament will feature 16 community teams of children under the age of 15 in football, 8 arts schools, and music and dance competing for the title of Peace Tournament Champions. Each participating team, group, and arts school will be honored with trophies, medals, and equipment in football, arts, and music. In addition, prizes will be awarded for the spirit of solidarity. The importance of organizing such an event cannot be overstated. Beyond the obvious benefits of physical activity and skill development, during our event we will be offering community peace culture education sessions, covering topics such as peace building, peace promoting and peace education in general. We have also planned engaging games for children from all refugee communities to participate in throughout the event. The Peace Tournament serves as a catalyst for empowerment, self-expression and trust building among participants. It provides a space where children can be seen, heard and valued for their abilities, their peace cultures fostering a sense of belonging and pride. The impact of hosting the Peace Tournament continues to be that all refugee children in Nakivale Camp come together in UNITY and PEACE. It has the power to change perceptions, challenge stereotypes and create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for refugees. Over the years, as we evolve, and in this evolution, they realize that only supportive dialogue and unity, friendship is not disrupting peace but creating hope, But violence is rather the act accomplished from a form of disruption. Through this solidarity initiative, we have the opportunity not only to celebrate diversity, but also to highlight the common humanity that unites all children. In conclusion, the \"PEACE TOURNAMENT 2025\" project sees the promotion of community peace as much more than just a sporting event: it is a testimony to the resilience, strength and potential of refugees. We believe that by supporting this initiative, volunteers can actively contribute to creating a more harmonious and compassionate world where everyone has the opportunity to shine and flourish."
