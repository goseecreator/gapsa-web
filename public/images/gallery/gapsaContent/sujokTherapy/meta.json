  "description": "Please come and learn about SUJOK THERAPY in Uganda nakivale refugees settlement. Sujok therapy was discovered by Professor Park Jae Woo from South Korea. He studied all the healing systems of the world. He realized that the hand is similar to the body and because of that the hand is like a remote control for the body. Since they are similar, information exchange can take place. When you stimulate points on the hands, the parts of the body can be helped to heal. The body has its own self healing capability. Sujok therapy helps to awaken that self healing capability. Professor Park Jae Woo realized that this simple healing method is a gift of Creator Spirit. He felt that at least one person on every household should know Sujok. Also, because the hand is like a remote control, it can influence the body but can never harm it. That\u2019s why what is taught to you can be taught to others. Please be very clear when you share the information The teacher who introduced Sujok to you is Bhupinder Kaur from India. She was Professor\u2019s student for many years and a certified teacher for many years. Professor encouraged the use of natural tools like twigs, leaves, seeds, beans, because they are similar to human energy. So they are the best tools and easily available to everyone Massage of points in hands can be with our own thumbs, fingers, knuckles also. A good collaboration between India, USA and Uganda. With simple techniques and natural tools, health is literally in everyone's hands Thank you so much Meenakshi Suri CoCreator Circle: A World That Benefits All Beings"
