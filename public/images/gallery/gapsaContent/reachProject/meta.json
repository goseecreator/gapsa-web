Global Alliance for peace and solidarity for Africa is implementing the\"#Resilience_Through_Empowerment_and_Advocacy_for_Children\" \u201c#REACH\u201d project to ensure that children and their families can access age- and gender-appropriate child protection services that are community-led and aligned with government structures, including the provision of alternative care for unaccompanied and separated children, sustainable access to services and a reduction in violence. There have been reports that most children are abused and there is no response to this abuse. There is a high dropout rate here. In Nakivale Refugee Camp, children are trafficked and child labour is practiced, which violates their rights."
