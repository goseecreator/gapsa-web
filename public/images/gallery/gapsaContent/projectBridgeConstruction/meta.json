Infrastructure in the camp is often limited, making daily life difficult for residents. Challenge Children from New Hope Village in Nakivale Camp struggled to cross a road to get to school due to the lack of a safe bridge. This situation posed a safety risk and could lead to school delays or absences. Partnership The Kiwanis Club of Nakivale and the Global Alliance for Peace and Solidarity for Africa joined forces to address this critical need. Together, they decided to build a bridge to facilitate the crossing for both children and the local population. Bridge Construction The construction of the bridge required careful planning and execution. Key steps included: 1. Site Assessment: Identify the best location for the bridge and assess the terrain conditions. 2. Design: Design a safe and durable bridge that meets the community's needs. 3. Construction: Carry out construction work using appropriate materials and adhering to safety standards. Impact The construction of the bridge has had a significant impact on the lives of children and the local community. Benefits include: 1. Improved Safety: Children can now safely cross the road to get to school. 2. Easier Access: The bridge facilitates access to the school and other essential services for the community. 3. Community Strengthening: The project has strengthened ties between community members and demonstrated the importance of collaboration in solving local problems. Thank you"
