His goal was to create a cultural holiday for Black Americans to reconnect with their African roots, foster unity, and celebrate collective identity. Kwanzaa is celebrated from December 26th to January 1st and each day is dedicated to one of the Nguzo Saba (the seven principles): 1\u20e3 Umoja (unity): Striving to achieve and maintain unity within family, community, and nation. 2\u20e3 Kujichagulia (Self-determination): Defining, naming, and creating for ourselves. 3\u20e3 Ujima (Collective work and responsibility): Building and solving problems together. 4\u20e3 Ujamaa (Cooperative economics): Supporting black businesses and sharing wealth. 5\u20e3 Nia (Purpose): Engaging in the collective calling of building and uplifting the community. 6\u20e3 Kuumba (Creativity): Using creativity to leave the community better than we found it. 7\u20e3 Imani (Faith): Believing in our people, our culture, and our future. A kinara, which contains seven candles (three red, three green, and one black), is lit each evening to reflect the principles. Celebrations include vibrant music, dance, art, storytelling, and traditional foods. Families also exchange meaningful gifts that reflect the values of Kwanzaa. \ud83c\udf81 Kwanzaa is not a religious holiday but a cultural one, open to all who value its principles of unity, resilience, and collective progress. Let\u2019s honor our history and build a better future together! \ud83d\udc9a\u2764\ud83d\udda4 We will organize a ceremony around a fire on Saturday as a reminder of African culture."
