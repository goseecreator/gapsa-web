            The Nakivale Community strongly believes that our football, art, and music tournaments align with our mission of promoting solidarity through community service. The youth tournaments bring together the whole community in a spirit of collaboration and competition. Allowing the diverse cultures, languages, and challenges of the Nakivale population into unity.

            The Football Tournaments promote peace through fair play and healthy relating. The Arts and Musical Tournaments showcase and support the talents of refugee children. By fostering social cohesion and promoting peace among refugees, we aim to create an environment that allows children to thrive and find solace away from the stress associated with their displacement.

                    The main objective of organizing the Peace Tournament in the Refugee Community is to provide a platform for refugee families to not only showcase their sporting, musical, and artsâ€™ prowess, but also to promote unity, understanding, and integration within the international community that comprises the Nakivale Settlement.

                    The importance of organizing such an event cannot be overstated. Beyond the obvious benefits of physical activity and skill development, we offer community peace culture education sessions covering peace building, conflict resolution, non-violent communication, and inclusion.
